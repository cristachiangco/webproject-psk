The roseum plant is a low-growing succulent that only gets to be about four to six inches tall. It is a fast grower that works great in containers or planters on a windowsill. In the summer, the roseum develops clusters of light-pink star flowers that can add a pop of color to your home decor. It can also add texture to a floral arrangement. This succulent prefers full sun to partial shade, so we recommend placing it on a windowsill that gets a decent amount of light.
