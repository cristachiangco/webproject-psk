This plant draws attention for two reasons: their namesake forked fronds that look a bit like antlers and their unique growth. Staghorns are epiphytes, which means that in nature they grow on other plants. So they don't need to grow in a pot of soil like other plants do. Instead, use them as statement-making displays, like mounted on boards hung on the wall. Water them like you would air plants, by misting them or soaking their roots in water.
