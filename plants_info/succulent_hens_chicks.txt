Sempervivum means “live forever,” which makes this succulent perfect for those that don’t have a natural knack for growing. The hens-and-chicks succulent can propagate very quickly and produce multiple offspring called “chicks”. With over 3,000 different species, this sempervivum species comes in a wide array of colors that you can mix and match in your garden.

When given proper care, they can produce beautiful red flowers that bloom together in the shape of a crown. This succulent only lives for about three years, but because of its ability to quickly propagate they “live forever.”
