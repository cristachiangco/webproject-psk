Rex begonias (Begonia rex) are tropical plants, prized for their colorfully patterned and intriguingly shaped leaves. Although they are at home in a shady garden, they are also popular as houseplants. Many people collect and display several varieties. Most rex begonias sold today are named hybrids, although they are not always labeled as such.
Rex begonia hybrids have been developed to have unusual markings, leaf shapes, and colors. The leaves grow on short leaf stalks, from the underground rhizome. The leaf edges and undersides are covered with short red hairs.
Leaves : Asymmetrical, the leaves are usually 4â€“9 inches long and variegated in shades of green, red, pink, purple, silver, and brown.
Native Area : South and Central America, Africa, southern Asia
