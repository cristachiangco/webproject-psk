Gardeners have been overwintering geranium plants for years. You can allow them to go dormant until spring, but if you have a bright south-facing window, you can have repeat blooms all winter. Geraniums that have been growing outdoors in pots make the best candidates because their roots will not be disturbed. Bring them in before frost and give the plants a light trim.
The Pelargonium species most often go by the common name annual geraniums or zonal geraniums. These tropical perennials from South Africa are usually grown as annuals, though it is possible to overwinter them in very warm climates. Annual geraniums are favorites for container plantings and hanging baskets, and they also work well as bedding plants.
Mature Size : 5 to 36 inches tall, depending on variety
Native Area : Species are from Southern Africa; most are now cultivated hybrids
Toxicity : Toxic to humans and animals (The toxic parts of the plants are the leaves, which can also cause contact dermatitis. Symptoms related to ingestion include vomiting, depression, anorexia, and gastrointestinal upset. Ingesting large quantities of leaves can cause hypothermia and muscle weakness, primarily in cats.)
